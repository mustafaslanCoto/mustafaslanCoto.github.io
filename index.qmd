I am currently pursuing a PhD at Cardiff Business School, where I specialise in developing AI&machine learning models for healthcare management. My research involves developing and refining advanced statistical&machine learning techniques to analyse complex datasets, aiming to enhance decision-making processes in real-world applications. In addition to my PhD work, I manage the Learning Labs workshop series, providing training on machine learning, statistics, reinforcement learning and forecasting methodologies using Python. I am also responsible for organizing seminars for the [Data Lab for Social Good](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/research/explore/research-units/data-lab-for-social-good), delivering sessions on AI, machine learning, forecasting, mathematical modeling, and optimization techniques.
