I am a PhD researcher in the [Data Lab for Social Good Research Group](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/research/explore/research-units/data-lab-for-social-good) at Cardiff University, UK. My research focuses on reducing delays and inefficiencies in hospital discharge processes and patient flow. Specifically, I work to improve discharge care coordination and operational effectiveness, including workforce planning and patient care delivery. To achieve this, I develop decision-making frameworks that integrate probabilistic predictive models with sequential optimization techniques. My work also leverages machine learning based causal inference methods to provide actionable insights for healthcare providers and administrators on the factors contributing to discharge delays and inefficiencies. In addition to my PhD work, I lead research seminars within the Data Lab for Social Good Research Group.

I am passionate about mathematical modeling and uncertany quantification to address complex healthcare challenges under uncertainty. I particularly enjoy building these models from scratch in Python as reusable packages, with applications in healthcare operations and patient care delivery.
