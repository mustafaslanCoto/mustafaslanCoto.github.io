I am currently pursuing a PhD at Cardiff Business School, where I specialise in developing AI&machine learning models for healthcare management. My research involves developing and refining advanced statistical&machine learning techniques to analyse complex datasets, aiming to enhance decision-making processes in real-world applications. I hold a masterâ€™s degree in Financial Mathematics from the Institute of Applied Mathematics, where I deepened my knowledge and skills in statistical and machine learning modelling. With two years of professional experience as a data scientist, I have gained practical expertise in data analysis and the development of predictive models using Python in a banking environment. This experience has equipped me with a solid understanding of how to apply mathematical concepts to solve business challenges effectively.
