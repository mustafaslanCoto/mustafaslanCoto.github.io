## **WORK EXPERINCES**

\sectionline

**Reporting and Data Analytics Executive**\
[**AKBANK (a leading bank in Turkey), Istanbul**]{.cvinstitution} \hfill [*Jun 2022 --- Sep 2024*]{.cvdate}

-   Applied time-series forecasting and machine learning techniques, including ARIMA, Bayesian Time Series, Prophet, ANN, LSTM, Random Forest, LightGBM and XGBoost, to historical data for making long-horizon forecasts of daily customer call volume. The best model achieved over 94% accuracy (1-MAPE) in forecasting all days of the next month.
-   Implemented machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) to predict customer behavior with an over recall rate of 70% and an accuracy rate of 85%, enabling fewer customer complaints and increase sales by 14%.
-   Analyzing large amounts of data to identify trends and find patterns, signals and hidden stories within customer calls data.
-   Applied machine learning techniques (Z-score, IsolationForest) to detect anomalies.
-   Applied unsupervised machine learning techniques (DBSCAN, Gaussian mixture, K-means) to cluster customers.
-   Hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models using Hyperopt, Optuna and KerasTuner.

**Research Associate**\
[**The Economic Policy Research Foundation of Turkey (Think Tank), Ankara**]{.cvinstitution} \hfill [*Jan 2022 --- Apr 2024*]{.cvdate}

-   Determined areas of research to increase knowledge in the particular field.
-   Utilizing inferential statistics such as hypothesis testing (e.g., t-test, ANOVA test, population proportion test), confidence intervals, correlation analysis and regression analysis to make inferences and draw conclusions about data.
-   Developed statistical models (regression analysis, panel data modeling) for regional development projects to contribute to data-driven decisions.

**Senior Process Development Analyst**\
[**ETI GIDA Inc (a major FMCG player in Turkey), Eskisehir**]{.cvinstitution} \hfill [*Jun 2019 --- Jan 2022*]{.cvdate}
