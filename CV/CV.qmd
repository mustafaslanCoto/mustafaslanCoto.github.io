## **WORK EXPERIENCES**

\sectionline

**Reporting and Data Analytics Executive**\
[**AKBANK (a leading bank in Turkey), Istanbul**]{.cvinstitution} \hfill [*Jun 2022 --- Sep 2024*]{.cvdate}

-   Applied time-series forecasting and machine learning techniques, including ARIMA, Bayesian Time Series, Prophet, ANN, LSTM, Random Forest, LightGBM and XGBoost, to historical data for making long-horizon forecasts of daily customer call volume. The winning model helped to allocate resources effectively, reducing customer wait times by 6%.

-   Analyzing large amounts of data to identify trends and find patterns, signals and hidden stories within customer calls data.
-   Applied machine learning techniques (Z-score, IsolationForest) to detect anomalies.
-   Applied unsupervised machine learning techniques (DBSCAN, Gaussian mixture, K-means) to cluster customers.
-   Hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models using Hyperopt, Optuna and KerasTuner.
