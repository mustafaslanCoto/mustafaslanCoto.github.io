# What is reinforcement learning

## Reinforcement Learning

-   Reinforcement learning is learning what to do—how to map situations to actions to maximize a numerical reward signal.
-   The learner is not told which actions to take, but instead must discover which actions yield the most reward by trying them.

# Elements of Reinforcement Learning

## Elements of Reinforcement Learning

-   *Agent* is the learner and decision maker.

    -   It interacts with the environment (comprising everything outside the agent) continually to select actions\
    -   The environment responds to these actions and presents new situations to the agent.

-   A *policy* defines the learning agent’s way of behaving at a given time.

    -   A mapping from states of the environment to actions to be taken when in those states.

-   The *reward* signal indicates what is good immediately after each decision time.

-   A *value function* specifies what is good in the long run.

    -   The value of a state is the total amount of reward an agent can expect to accumulate over the future, starting from that state.

## Elements of Reinforcement Learning

![The agent–environment interaction in a decision process](images_rl/agent_environment.png){.r-stretch}

Agent gives rise to a `sequence` that begins like this

$$
S_0, A_0, R_1, S_1, A_1, R_2, S_2, A_2, R_3, \dots  S_t, A_t, R_{t+1}
$$

## Goals and Rewards {.smaller}

-   At each time step, the reward is a simple number, $R_t \in \mathbb{R}$ passing from the environment to the agent.
-   The agent’s goal is to maximize the total (cumulative) amount of reward it receives in the long run.
-   The aim is to maximize the *`expected return`*, $G_t$, which is defined as: $$
    G_t \doteq R_{t+1} + R_{t+2} + R_{t+3}+ \dots+R_T
    $$

*Discounting* technique is used to prioritize immediate rewards over future rewards.

-   The idea is to multiply future rewards by a discount factor $\gamma \in (0,1]$
-   This makes future rewards worth less than immediate rewards.
-   The return $G_t$ with discounting is defined as:

$$
G_t \doteq R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + \gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \cdots = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k R_{t+k+1}
$$

## Policies and Value Functions

-   A **policy** is a mapping from states to probabilities of selecting each possible action. If the agent is following policy $\pi$ at time $t$, then $\pi(a \mid s)$ is the probability that $A_t = a$ if $S_t = s$

-   *`Value functions—functions of states (or of state–action pairs)`* estimate *how good* it is for the agent to be in a given state (or how good it is to perform a given action in a given state)

    -   The *value function* of a state $s$ under a policy $\pi$, denoted $v_\pi(s)$ is: $$
        v_\pi(s) \doteq \mathbb{E}_\pi[G_t | S_t=s] = \mathbb{E}_\pi\left[\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k R_{t+k+1} \mid S_t=s\right], \text{ for all } s \in \mathbf{S},
        $$

where $\mathbb{E}[\cdot]$ denotes the expected value of a random variable given that the agent follows policy $\pi$, and $t$ is any time step.

### `Model-based`

::: fragment
-   The agent knows/learns the model of the environment
-   They then compute the policy using the ADP methods or the model-free methods on simulated data

**Pros:**

-   Sample efficient
-   Safer exploration

**Cons:**

-   Prone to the model errors
-   Learning a model is challenging

:::: {.column width="50%"}
### `Model-free`

::: fragment
-   The agent does not know the model of the environment
-   They learn the values or policies from trial-and-error interactions with the environment

**Pros:**

-   Do not need a model
-   Flexible

**Cons:**

-   Sample inefficient: requires a lot of interactions with the environment

## Model-based methods

Conditional probability of the next state given the current state and action taken
$$
p(s' \mid s, a) \doteq \Pr \{ S_t = s' \mid S_{t-1} = s, A_{t-1} = a \}, \text{ for all } s',s \in S, \text{and} a \in A(s)
$$

The function $p$ defines the *dynamics* of the MDP

$p(s', \mid s, a)$ is a *dynamics function* and $p$ specifies a probability distribution for each choice of $s$ and $a$, that is:
$$
\sum_{s'\in S}p(s'\mid s, a) = 1, \text{ for all } s \in S, a \in A(s)
$$

## Model-based methods

-   They are used to derive optimal policies and value functions in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and reinforcement learning.

#### Bellman Equations

-   The Bellman equations express the relationship between the value of a state and the values of its successor states. For the state-value function $v_\pi$, the Bellman equation is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_\pi(s) &\doteq \mathbb{E}_\pi \big[G_t \mid S_t = s \big] \\
         &= \mathbb{E}_\pi \big[R_{t+1} + \gamma G_{t+1} \mid S_t = s \big] \\
         &= \mathbb{E}_\pi \big[R_{t+1} + \gamma v_\pi(S_{t+1}) \mid S_t = s \big] \\
         &= \sum_a \pi(a \mid s) \sum_{s',r} p(s', r \mid s, a) \big[ r + \gamma v_\pi(s') \big].
\end{aligned}
$$

## Model-based methods {.smaller}

-   An optimal policy is a policy that achieves the maximum expected return from any initial state.

-   The optimal state-value function $v_*$ is the maximum value function over all policies:
$$
v_*(s) = \max_\pi v_\pi(s), \text{ for all } s \in \mathcal{S}
$$

-   The optimal action-value function $q_*$ is the maximum action-value function over all policies:
$$
q_*(s, a) = \max_\pi q_\pi(s, a), \text{ for all } s \in \mathcal{S}, a \in \mathcal{A}(s)
$$

We use Dynamic Programming (DP) to leverage value functions in the search for good policies.

-   The Bellman optimality equation for $v_*$ is:
$$
\begin{aligned}
v_*(s) &= \max_a \mathbb{E} \big[R_{t+1} + \gamma v_*(S_{t+1}) \mid S_{t} = s, A_{t} = a  \big] \\
        &= \max_a \sum_{s',r}p(s',r|s,a) \big[r+\gamma v_*(s')],
\end{aligned}
$$

-   The Bellman optimality equation for $q_*$ is:
$$
q_*(s, a) = \sum_{s', r} p(s', r \mid s, a) \big[ r + \gamma \max_{a'} q_*(s', a') \big]
$$

## Policy Evalulation (Prediction) {.smaller}

*Policy evaluation* is the computation of the state-value function $v_\pi$ for an arbitrary policy $\pi$. We also refer to it as the \*prediction problem.
$$
\begin{aligned}
v_\pi(s) &\doteq \mathbb{E}_\pi \big[G_t \mid S_t = s \big] \\
         &= \mathbb{E}_\pi \big[R_{t+1} + \gamma G_{t+1} \mid S_t = s \big] \\
         &= \mathbb{E}_\pi \big[R_{t+1} + \gamma v_\pi(S_{t+1}) \mid S_t = s \big] \\
         &= \sum_a \pi(a \mid s) \sum_{s',r} p(s', r \mid s, a) \big[ r + \gamma v_\pi(s') \big].
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\pi(a|s)$ is the probability of taking action $\alpha$ in state $s$ under policy $\pi$, and the expectations are subscripted by $\pi$ to indicate that they are conditional on $\pi$ being followed.

Consider a sequence of approximate value functions $v_0, v_1, v_2,\dots,$. Each successive approximation is obtained by using the Bellman equation for $v_\pi$ as an update rule:

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{k+1}(s) &\doteq \mathbb{E}_\pi \big[R_{t+1} + \gamma v_k(S_{t+1}) \mid S_t = s \big] \\
         &= \sum_a \pi(a \mid s) \sum_{s',r} p(s', r \mid s, a) \big[ r + \gamma v_k(s') \big].
\end{aligned}
$$

## Policy Evalulation (Prediction)

The sequence ${v_k}$ can be shown in general to converge to $v_\pi$ as $k \rightarrow \infty$ under the same conditions that guarantee the existence of $v_\pi$. This algorithm is called *iterative policy evaluation*.

 $\Delta \leftarrow \max(\Delta, |v - V(s)|)$\
**until** $\Delta < \theta$
:::

## Policy Improvement {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column .fragment width="50%" style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   We know how good it is to follow the current policy from $s$—that is $v_\pi(s)$—but would it be better or worse to change to the new policy?

One way to answer this question is to consider selecting $a$ in $s$ and thereafter following the existing policy $\pi$.

This leads to the definition of the *q-value* of a state-action pair:

$$
\begin{aligned}
q_\pi(s, a) &\doteq \mathbb{E} \big[ R_{t+1} + \gamma v_\pi(S_{t+1}) \mid S_t = s, A_t = a \big] \\
     &= \sum_{s', r} p(s', r \mid s, a) \big[ r + \gamma v_\pi(s') \big].
\end{aligned}
$$
:::

::: {.column .fragment width="50%" style="font-size: 70%;"}
The policy improvement theorem states that if we improve the policy by acting greedily with respect to $q_\pi$, the new policy $\pi'$ will be at least as good as $\pi$.

Formally, if

$$
\begin{aligned}
\pi'(s) &= \arg\max_a q_\pi(s, a) \\
&= \arg \max_a \mathbb{E} \big[R_{t+1}+\gamma v_\pi(S_{t+1}) \mid S_t=s, A_t=a \big] \\
&= \arg \max_a \sum_{s',r}p(s',r \mid s, a) \big[r+\gamma v_\pi(s') \big]
\end{aligned}
$$

then

$$
v_{\pi'}(s) \geq v_\pi(s).
$$

for all $s \in \mathcal{S}$.
:::
:::::

## Policy Iteration

Once a policy, $\pi$, has been improved using $v_\pi$ to yield a better policy, $\pi^{'}$, we can then compute $v_{\pi^{'}}$ and improve it again to yield an even better $\pi^{''}$.

$$
\pi_0 \xrightarrow E v_{\pi_0} \xrightarrow I \pi_1 \xrightarrow E v_{\pi_1}\xrightarrow I \pi_2,\dots,\xrightarrow I \pi_* \     xrightarrow E v_*
$$

where $\xrightarrow E$ denotes a policy *evaluation* and $\xrightarrow I$ denotes a policy *improvement*. This way of finding an optimal policy is called policy iteration.

If *policy-stable*, then stop and return $V \approx v_*$ and $\pi \approx \pi_*$;\
Else go to step 2
:::

## Value Iteration

-   One drawback to policy iteration is that each of its iterations involves policy evaluation, which may itself be a protracted iterative computation requiring multiple sweeps through the state set.
-   Value iteration is a special case of policy iteration where the policy evaluation step is truncated to just one sweep.
-   This algorithm combines the policy improvement and truncated policy evaluation steps into a single update operation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{k+1}(s) &= \mathbb{E} \big[R_{t+1} + \gamma v_k(S_{t+1}) \mid S_t=s, A_t = a \big] \\
       &=\max_a \sum_{s', r} p(s', r \mid s, a) \big[ r + \gamma v_k(s') \big] 
\end{aligned}
$$

for all $s \in \mathcal{S}$.

## Value Iteration {.smaller}

-   Value iteration is obtained simply by turning the Bellman optimality equation into an update rule.
-   Also note how the value iteration update is identical to the policy evaluation update except that it requires the maximum to be taken over all actions.

-   GPI is a general idea that describes how two processes — *evaluating a policy and improving it* — work together and influence each other.

-   Most reinforcement learning algorithms use a value function to judge how good a policy is, and then update the policy based on that judgment.

-   If both value estimation and policy improvement stabilize (i.e., stop changing), then the policy must be the best possible one for that value function—meaning the policy is optimal.

# Model-free methods

# Monte Carlo Methods

## Monte Carlo (MC) Methods

-   The term “Monte Carlo” is often used more broadly for any estimation method whose operation involves a significant random component.

-   MC methods solve reinforcement learning problems by averaging results (returns) from sampled experiences sequences of states, actions, and rewards.

-   They do not require knowledge of the environment's dynamics, making them powerful for learning from real or simulated experiences.

## Monte Carlo Prediction {.smaller}

-   Suppose we wish to estimate $v_{\pi}(s)$, the values of a state $s$ under policy $\pi$, given a set of episodes obtained by following $\pi$ and passing through $s$.

:::

## Monte Carlo Control without Exploring Starts {.smaller}

-   In on-policy control methods the policy is generally **soft**, meaning that $\pi(a\mid s)>0$ for all $s \in \mathcal{S}$ and all $a \in \mathcal{A(s)}$, but gradually shifted closer and closer to a deterministic policy.
-   The on-policy method we present in this section uses $\epsilon$-greedy policies, meaning that most of the time they choose an action that has maximal estimated action value, but with probability $\epsilon$ they instead select an action at random. That is, all nongreedy actions are given the minimal probability of selection, $\frac{\epsilon}{|\mathcal{A(s)}|}$, and the remaining bulk of the probability $1-\epsilon+\frac{\epsilon}{|\mathcal{A(s)}|}$ is given to the greedy action.
-   $\epsilon$-greedy policies are examples of $\epsilon-soft$ policies, definied as policies for which $\pi(a \mid s) \geq \frac{\epsilon}{|\mathcal{A(s)}|}$ for all states and actions, for some $\epsilon > 0$. Among $\epsilon$-soft policies, $\epsilon$-greedy policies are in some sense those that are closest to greedy.

\varepsilon / |\mathcal{A}(S_t)| & \text{if } a \ne A^*
\end{cases}$
:::

where $|\mathcal{A}(s)|$ is the number of actions available in state $s$.

The $\epsilon$-greedy policy ensures that all actions are tried, but actions with higher value estimates are tried more frequently. This balances exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (choosing the best-known action).

# Temporal-Difference Learning

## Temporal-Difference Learning

-   TD learning is a combination of Monte Carlo ideas and dynamic programming (DP) ideas.
-   Like Monte Carlo methods, TD methods can learn directly from raw experience without a model of the environment’s dynamics.
-   Like DP, TD methods update estimates based in part on other learned estimates, without waiting for a final outcome (they bootstrap).

## TD Prediction

Whereas Monte Carlo methods must wait until the end of the episode to determine the increment to $V(St)$ (only then is $G_t$ known), TD methods need to wait only until the next time step. At time t + 1 they immediately form a target and make a useful update using the observed reward $R_{t+1}$ and the estimate $V_{S_{t+1}}$. The simplest TD method makes the update:

$$
V(S_t) \leftarrow V(S_t) + \alpha \big[ R_{t+1} + \gamma V(S_{t+1})-V(S_t)  \big]
$$

immediately on transition to $S_{t+1}$ and receiving $R_{t+1}$. In effect, the target for the Monte Carlo update is $G_t$, whereas the target for the TD update is $R_{t+1} + \gamma V(S_{t+1})$. This TD method is called TD(0), or *one-step* TD.

## The difference between on-policy and off-policy {.smaller}

### On-Policy Learning

Learns about the policy it is currently using to make decisions.

The same policy is used for both:

-   Acting (exploring the environment)

-   Learning (updating value functions)

Example: SARSA

-   Updates Q-values using the action that was actually taken.

-   Learns the value of the $\varepsilon$-greedy policy it follows.

### Off-Policy Learning

Learns about one policy while following another.

Uses:

-   A behavior policy for exploration (e.g., $\varepsilon$-greedy)

-   A target policy for learning (e.g., greedy)

Example: Q-learning

-   Even if the agent explores randomly, it updates Q-values based on the best possible action (max over Q), as if it was following a greedy policy.

## Example: {.smaller}

🎯 Imagine you're learning to play chess.

🧑 On-policy (SARSA-like):

-   You’re learning by watching yourself play, including your mistakes and explorations.
-   You play games using a mix of good and random moves (e.g., trying new strategies).
-   You update your knowledge based on what you actually did in each game.
-   You get better at playing the way you currently play, gradually improving it.

✅ On-policy:

You learn the value of the policy you're following.

👀 Off-policy (Q-learning-like):

-   You’re learning how a grandmaster would play, while still playing your own games.
-   You still explore (e.g., try risky moves), but...
-   When updating your knowledge, you ask what the best move would have been, not the one you actually chose.
-   You get better at playing like the grandmaster, even though you're not playing like them yet.

✅ This is off-policy:

You learn the value of a different, better policy (often greedy), while following a more exploratory one.

## Notes

-   **Reinforcement learning** is a framework for learning how to interact with environment from experience.
-   Agent takes actions to interact with environment
-   The big challange in RL Design a policy of what actions to take given a state s to maximize a future reward
-   Q(s,a) tells us what is the quality of being in state s and taking action a. Then once I find myself in a state s, I just have to look across all of the actions and pick the one that gives the best quality. If I do that in future I will maximize my value.
