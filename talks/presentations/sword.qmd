## Context

At the [`SWORD Network Event`](https://www.theorsociety.com/ORS/Community/Regionals-List/South-Wales-OR-Network.aspx), we will present our PhD research on enhancing discharge care planning using a probabilistic data-driven approach. This research is designed to capture the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of patient flow and resource utilization in healthcare settings.
