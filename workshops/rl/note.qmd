- **Model-Free Adaptation**:  Learns optimal behavior directly from experience, without needing an explicit model of the environment.  

- **Long-Term Planning**: Optimizes decisions over long time horizons by balancing immediate vs. future rewards.  
- **Scalable to Complex Tasks**  
  Can handle very large state-action spaces via function approximation (e.g., neural networks).  
- **Interactive Settings**  
  Ideal when you have an agent interacting with an environment (games, robotics, resource allocation).  
- **Data-Driven Policies**  
  Automatically refines its policy as more data becomes available, making it robust to non-stationarity.
