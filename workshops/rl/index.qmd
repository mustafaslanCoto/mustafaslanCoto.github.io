## Who is the course for?
This course is designed for researchers and postgraduate students who want to apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) to real-world decision-making in interdisciplinary settings, including supply chains, healthcare, and operational contexts across diverse industries. It is especially relevant for those working on problems involving sequential decision-making under uncertainty.

You don’t need prior RL knowledge, but you should be comfortable with basic probability and Python programming.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

- Understand the core ideas of RL in the context of healthcare decision-making
- Model sequential sequential decisions using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
- Apply key RL algorithms (Monte Carlo, SARSA, Q-learning) to learn optimal policies from experience
- Interpret learned policies and value functions in a healthcare context (e.g. when to treat, when to wait)
- Link RL insights to practical policy decisions like cost control, clinical risk, or stockout mitigation

## Prerequisites
- Familiarity with basic probability and statistics (e.g., expected value, random variables)
- Some experience with Python, particularly with lists, dictionaries, and basic control flow
- No prior knowledge of RL or advanced machine learning is required
