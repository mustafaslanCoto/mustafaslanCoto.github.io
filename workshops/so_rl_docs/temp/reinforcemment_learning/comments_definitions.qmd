- **Reinforcement learning** is a framework for learning how to interact with environment from experience.
- Agent takes actions to interact with environment
- The big challange in RL Design a policy of what actions to take given a state s to maximize a future reward
- Q(s,a) tells us what is the quality of being in state s and taking action a. Then once I find myself in a state s, I just have to look across all of the actions and pick the one that gives the best quality. If I do that in future I will maximize my value.
