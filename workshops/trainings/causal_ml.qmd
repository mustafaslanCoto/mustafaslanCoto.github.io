**Date:** February 13, 2026 10:00 AM – 13:00 PM\
**Event:** Data Lab for Social Good Training Session\
**Location:** Aberconway Building Meeting Room, Cardiff University, UK

## Who is the course for?

- Researchers and practitioners interested in understanding causal relationships in observational data
- Analysts working with high-dimensional datasets where traditional regression methods may fail
- Anyone seeking to combine modern machine learning techniques with rigorous causal inference frameworks
- Policy analysts and evaluators who need to estimate treatment effects from non-experimental data
- Those familiar with basic statistics who want to advance to cutting-edge methods in econometrics and causal ML

## What will you learn?

- The fundamental distinction between correlation and causation, and why it matters for real-world decision-making
- Core identification strategies: RCTs, IV, DiD, and their assumptions.
- The Double Lasso method for valid causal inference when the number of control variables is large
- Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML) for estimating causal effects in partially linear and fully interactive models
- How to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects and local average treatment effects (LATE) using modern ML methods
- Practical implementation skills through hands-on examples with real datasets

## Course Outline

- Motivation and Conceptual Foundations
- Identification
- Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)
- Introduction to Linear Regression
- Regularization Techniques for Linear Regression in High-Dimensional Settings
- Statistical Inference on Causal Effects in High Dimensional Linear Regression Models
- Statistical Inference on Predictive and Causal Effects in Modern Nonlinear Regression Models

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of statistics and probability theory
- Familiarity with linear regression and ordinary least squares (OLS)
- Working knowledge of statistical concepts such as expected values, variance, and correlation
- Basic programming skills (R)
- Understanding of matrix notation and basic linear algebra
- No prior knowledge of causal inference required – the course builds from foundational concepts
Helpful but not required: exposure to econometrics, machine learning basics, or policy evaluation methods
